        <h2>MOVLY Halving Mechanism</h2>

        <section className="popup-section">
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>MOVLY implements a dynamic halving mechanism that reduces earning rates based on the percentage of remaining tokens earned, ensuring sustainable and long-lasting distribution over time.</p>
        </section>

        <section className="popup-section">
          <h3>Total Supply</h3>
          <p>Maximum supply: 6,900,000,000 MOVLY</p>
          <p>The halving mechanism works on remaining tokens:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>First halving: When 25% of max supply is earned (1,725M MOVLY)
              <br />- Earning rate reduces by 25%
              <br />- Remaining supply: 5,175M MOVLY</li>
            <li>Second halving: When 25% of remaining supply is earned (1,293.75M MOVLY)
              <br />- Earning rate reduces by another 25%
              <br />- New remaining supply: 3,881.25M MOVLY</li>
            <li>Third halving: When 25% of new remaining supply is earned (970.31M MOVLY)
              <br />- Earning rate reduces by another 25%
              <br />- Process continues...</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="popup-section">
          <h3>Earning Rate Formula</h3>
          <p>Current Rate = Base Rate Ã— (Current Reduction Factor)</p>
          <p>Where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Base Rate: Initial earning rate</li>
            <li>Reduction Factor: Decreases by 25% each time users earn 25% of remaining supply</li>
            <li>Process continues indefinitely, making tokens increasingly scarce</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="popup-section">
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>Starting with Base Rate = 100 MOVLY/day:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Initial Phase:
              <br />- Full rate: 100 MOVLY/day
              <br />- Until 1,725M tokens earned (25% of 6,900M)</li>
            <li>First Reduction:
              <br />- Rate reduces to: 75 MOVLY/day
              <br />- Until 1,293.75M more tokens earned (25% of 5,175M)</li>
            <li>Second Reduction:
              <br />- Rate reduces to: 56.25 MOVLY/day
              <br />- Until 970.31M more tokens earned (25% of 3,881.25M)</li>
            <li>Pattern continues:
              <br />- Each time 25% of remaining tokens are earned
              <br />- Rate reduces by 25% of current rate</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <h3>Benefits</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Truly sustainable long-term distribution</li>
            <li>Natural scarcity increases over time</li>
            <li>Rewards early participants while maintaining long-term earning potential</li>
            <li>Dynamic adjustment based on actual token circulation</li>
            <li>Theoretically infinite earning cycles with decreasing rates</li>
