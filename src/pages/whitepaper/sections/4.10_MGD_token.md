# MGD Token (Movly Gold)

## Overview
MGD (Movly Gold) is the exclusive move-to-earn token of the Movly ecosystem. Unlike Movly token which is used for governance and ICO, MGD is purely designed as a reward token that users can only earn through physical activities and healthy lifestyle choices. This token represents the core of our move-to-earn mechanism, creating a direct link between physical activity and financial rewards.

   * Sustainable trading ecosystem

## Halving Mechanism
MGD implements a dynamic halving mechanism that ensures sustainable and long-lasting token distribution over time.

### How It Works
The halving process is triggered based on the percentage of remaining tokens earned:

1. First Halving
   - Triggers when 25% of max supply is earned (2,500M MGD)
   - Earning rate reduces by 25%
   - Remaining supply: 7,500M MGD

2. Second Halving
   - Triggers when 25% of remaining supply is earned (1,875M MGD)
   - Earning rate reduces by another 25%
   - New remaining supply: 5,625M MGD

3. Subsequent Halvings
   - Each time 25% of remaining supply is earned
   - Rate reduces by 25% of current rate
   - Process continues indefinitely

### Earning Rate Formula
Current Rate = Base Rate Ã— (Current Reduction Factor)
- Base Rate: Initial earning rate
- Reduction Factor: Decreases by 25% each halving
- Process makes tokens increasingly scarce over time

### Benefits
- Ensures truly sustainable long-term distribution
- Creates natural token scarcity over time
- Rewards early participants while maintaining long-term earning potential
- Dynamically adjusts based on actual token circulation
- Provides theoretically infinite earning cycles with decreasing rates
