# 4.2 Mana System

Mana represents the magical energy that powers your exercise journey in HealthStep. Just as in fantasy games where Mana is the mystical force that enables spellcasting, in HealthStep it represents your capacity to transform physical activity into tokens and rewards. Each point of Mana allows for 5 minutes of exercise session.

## Mana Basics
- Mana is required to earn HSE and Mystery Boxes
- Mana system activates after acquiring first NFT Sneaker
- Users must select a Sneaker and have Mana before starting exercise
- No tokens are earned when Mana is depleted

## Daily Mana Cap
- New users start with 2/2 Mana
- Maximum Mana Cap is 20/20
- Mana Cap can be increased by:
  - Acquiring more Sneakers
  - Owning higher-quality Sneakers
  - Combining both strategies for optimal results

## Mana Replenishment
- Mana replenishes at 25% every 6 hours
- Replenishment continues until reaching Mana Cap
- Mana Cap can be increased by holding more Sneakers

### Mana Cap by Sneaker Count
| Sneaker Count | Mana Cap | Activity Time (min) |
|---------------|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | 2 | 10 |
| 3 | 4 | 20 |
| 9 | 9 | 45 |
| 15 | 12 | 60 |
| 30 | 20 | 100 |

## Bonus Mana System
Higher quality sneakers provide bonus Mana (cumulative):

| Sneaker Quality | Bonus Mana |
|----------------|------------|
| Warrior | +0 |
| General | +1 |
| Knight | +2 |
| Lord | +3 |
| Sovereign | +4 |

### Examples
**Example 1:**
1 General Sneaker + 1 Warrior Sneaker = 3 Total Mana
- Base Mana (2) + General Bonus (1)

**Example 2:**
2 Knight Sneakers + 1 Warrior Sneaker = 8 Total Mana
- Base Mana (4) + Knight Bonus (2 Ã— 2)

## Mana Management
### Marketplace Impact
- Listing a Sneaker reduces both Mana and Mana Cap
- Mana and Cap are recalculated based on remaining Sneakers

### Transfer Cooldown
- Transferring Sneakers between accounts triggers a Cooldown period
- Sneakers cannot be used for exercise during Cooldown
- Cooldown period helps prevent abuse and maintains system integrity

*Note: Mana mechanics and bonuses are subject to adjustment based on platform economics and community feedback.*
