# Shoe Minting

Shoe-Minting Event (SME) is a feature where users can create new sneakers by combining two existing sneakers. The two parent sneakers must have 100% battery to perform a minting event.

### Minting Process
1. Users access the Mint tab in the app
2. Select two sneakers to use as parents
3. Pay the required minting cost
4. Receive a shoebox that can be opened immediately

### Minting Rules
- Each sneaker can be used for up to 7 minting events
- Minting costs increase with each use based on individual parent's minting count
- 48-hour cooldown period after minting (sneakers can still be used for exercise)
- First two mints have the same base cost
- Higher minting count increases chance for multiple shoeboxes

### Shoebox Quality Probability
The quality of the shoebox is determined by the parent sneakers' qualities:

| Parent Combination | Warrior Box % | General Box % | Knight Box % | Lord Box % | Sovereign Box % |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| Warrior x Warrior | 100 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Warrior x General | 50 | 49 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| Warrior x Knight | 50 | 0 | 49 | 1 | 0 |
| Warrior x Lord | 50 | 0 | 0 | 49 | 1 |
| Warrior x Sovereign | 50 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 50 |
| General x General | 0 | 98 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| General x Knight | 0 | 49 | 50 | 1 | 0 |
| General x Lord | 0 | 49 | 1 | 49 | 1 |
| General x Sovereign | 0 | 49 | 1 | 0 | 50 |
| Knight x Knight | 0 | 0 | 98 | 2 | 0 |
| Knight x Lord | 0 | 0 | 49 | 50 | 1 |
| Knight x Sovereign | 0 | 0 | 49 | 1 | 50 |
| Lord x Lord | 0 | 0 | 0 | 98 | 2 |
| Lord x Sovereign | 0 | 0 | 0 | 49 | 51 |
| Sovereign x Sovereign | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100 |

### Sneaker Quality Probability
When opening a shoebox, the sneaker quality is determined by the shoebox quality:

| Shoebox Quality | Warrior % | General % | Knight % | Lord % | Sovereign % |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Warrior | 97 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| General | 25 | 73 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| Knight | 0 | 27 | 71 | 2 | 0 |
| Lord | 0 | 0 | 30 | 68 | 2 |
| Sovereign | 0 | 0 | 0 | 35 | 65 |

### Minting Costs
- Base cost is calculated in HST and HSE
- Cost increases with each mint based on parent sneaker's mint count
- Additional cost for higher quality sneakers
- Multiple shoebox chance increases with higher mint count
