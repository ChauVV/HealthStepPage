# 4.5 Anti-Cheating System

## HealthGuard System
HealthStep employs the HealthGuard system to maintain fairness and authenticity in the ecosystem. This intelligent system handles common irregularities that may occur during normal usage, such as exercising near buildings, under tree cover, or in areas with weak GPS signals.

## Trust Score (TS)
The Trust Score system helps maintain platform integrity:

- All users start with 100 TS
- Maximum score is 120
- Displayed through a Traffic Light System
- Every successful 4 Mana consumption increases TS by 1
