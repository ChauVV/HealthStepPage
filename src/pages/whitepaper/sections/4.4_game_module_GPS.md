# GPS and Movement Verification

HealthStep employs a sophisticated GPS tracking system to ensure authentic exercise activities and prevent cheating. The system monitors movement patterns and signal quality to maintain fairness in the ecosystem.

## Movement Status
The app displays real-time movement status at the top of the screen:
- **Exercising**: Normal exercise movement detected
- **Invalid Movement**: Suspicious or non-organic movement detected

## Anti-Cheating Detection
The system identifies invalid movements such as:
- Using vehicles (cars, scooters, etc.)
- Artificial movement simulation
- GPS spoofing attempts
- Device manipulation

During Invalid Movement periods:
- No HSE is earned
- Mana may or may not be consumed
- Mystery Box drops are disabled

## GPS Signal Indicators
The app uses a color-coded system to display GPS status:

| Color  | Meaning | Impact |
|--------|---------|---------|
| White  | No GPS Signal | Cannot start exercise |
| Red    | Poor GPS Signal | Exercise possible but may trigger Invalid Movement |
| Green  | Strong GPS Signal | Optimal for exercise |

## Movement Verification
The system analyzes multiple factors:
- GPS signal strength
- Movement patterns
- Speed consistency
- Location accuracy
- Device motion sensors

## Important Notes
- Maintain good GPS signal for optimal earnings
- Stay in open areas when possible
- Keep device properly positioned during exercise
- Avoid sudden or unnatural movement patterns

*Note: The movement verification system is continuously updated to ensure fair play while maintaining a positive user experience.*
