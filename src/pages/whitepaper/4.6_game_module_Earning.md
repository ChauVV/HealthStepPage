# 4.6 HSE Earning

In HealthStep, users earn HSE tokens through physical activities using their NFT Sneakers. The earning system is designed to reward consistent exercise and proper movement patterns.

## Earning Mechanics
HSE earnings per minute are determined by three main factors:

### 1. Sneaker Quality
- Base HSE earnings vary by Sneaker quality tier
- Higher quality Sneakers provide better earning potential
- Each quality tier has its own earning multiplier:
  - Warrior: Base rate
  - General: 1.5x base rate
  - Knight: 2x base rate
  - Lord: 2.5x base rate
  - Sovereign: 3x base rate

### 2. Power Attribute
- Primary attribute affecting HSE earnings
- Higher Power increases earning efficiency
- Power can be enhanced through:
  - Leveling up
  - Wings enhancement
  - Halo enhancement

### 3. Movement Speed
- Optimal speed range: 1-20 km/h
- Speed affects earning efficiency:
  - Below 1 km/h: No earnings
  - 1-20 km/h: Full earnings
  - Above 20 km/h: Invalid movement (no earnings)

## Earning Rules
- Earnings only occur while Mana is available
- Must maintain proper movement patterns
- Trust Score affects earning capability
- Invalid movements pause earnings

## Session Management
- Users can view real-time earning rate
- Earnings stop when Mana depletes
- Can continue activity without earnings
- End session by holding Stop button
- Session summary shows total earnings

## Enhancement Effects
- Wings and Halo boost earning rate
- Higher levels provide greater boosts
- Enhancements stack multiplicatively
- Maximum boost at level 40
